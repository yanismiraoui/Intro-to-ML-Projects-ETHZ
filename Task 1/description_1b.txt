This submission aims to solve Task 1b. To solve this problem with the best score possible, we have mostly used Python with the pandas and sklearn libraries. 

To pass the baseline and get the best result possible, we have followed the instructions put in the task description. 
The first step to solve this task was to perform the transformations phi (e.g. exp(x_i), cos(x_i), ...). With these new transformed columns and features we build a simple Linear Regression model and store the values of its coefficients into a csv file in the correct submission format. 
This method led to a score passing and out performing the baseline. Indeed, our best result led to a score of 17.49197437048868 on the public leaderboard.
