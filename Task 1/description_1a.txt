This submission aims to solve Task 1a. To solve this problem with the best score possible, we have mostly used Python with the pandas and sklearn libraries. 

To pass the baseline and get the best result possible, we have followed the instructions put in the task description. 
The first step to solve this task was to determine the optimal way to implement 10-fold cross-validation. We used two simple methods in order to obtain the average of the RMSE over 10 test folds. 
The first method implements a for loop "by hand" and fits a Ridge regression model for each lamba before averaging over a 10 fold cross-validation. 
The second methods uses GridSearchCV to compute the average cross validation RMSE for the 5 different lambda values. GridSearchCV is a function of the sklearn package that allows to efficiently perform such a task.
This second method led to better results on the public leaderboard.
Indeed, our best result led to a score of 17.49197437048868 on the public leaderboard.
